### Time Savers Toolbar

This extension adds a new toolbar that adds command buttons for most *Time Savers* features giving you a
**one-click experience**.
To enable the toolbar, right-click in a blank spot on the toolbar area, and select *Time Savers*.

### Time Savers Menu

For people who prefer a menu to a toolbar this extension also adds a new menu to Visual Studio's main menu bar.
All *Time Savers* features are available via this menu giving you a simple
**two-click experience**.

### Context Menus

For people who hate having to move their mouse from the code they're working on,
another menu has been added to the context menu of any code window, as well as to some nodes in *Solution Explorer*.
Most *Time Savers* features are available via this context menu for a simple
**right-click experience**, without having to your mouse from the code you're working on.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Some of the *Time Savers* features that tend to be used frequently have also been assigned a keyboard shortcut
for a **one or two-click experience**.
And of course you can add your own keyboard shortcut to any of the *Time Savers* features.
